# OBJECTIVES: 
- extract statistics from [this dataset](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ksn02v76h#usage) : ISI and FRs
- check if these statistics relate to the statistics of the generative model. If not, improve the model to go in this direction (final objective would be to generate data with a ground truth for the motifs using stats from real data)
- check how the different types of noise are implemented and improve if necessary
- add time wrapping (strech and compress spiking motifs), especially relevant here for hippocampal replay
- assess the changes in statistics with behavior (optionnal)
